## Common Application Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Insufficient Income Documentation:** Many applications rejected for incomplete financial proof. Provide 12+ months of consistent income evidence.

2. **Apostille Timing:** Begin apostille process 3+ months before application. State processing varies wildly (California: 2-3 weeks, Texas: 8-12 weeks).

3. **Health Insurance Gaps:** Ensure continuous coverage from application through approval. Portuguese Social Security (SNS) not available until residence permit issued.

4. **Portuguese Address Requirement:** Must have confirmed housing before D7 application. Consider short-term rentals or hotel bookings for initial period.

5. **Tax Residency Confusion:** Spending 183+ days in Portugal triggers tax residency. Plan US/Portuguese tax obligations accordingly.
